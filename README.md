# Contacts from sites parser
Parse given list (text file) of urls for contact information, such as: 'phone', 'e-mail','telegram link','whatsapp link', 'vkontakte link'
If not all information found on a page with link provided, tries to open and lookup at Contacts page of same site.
Saves gathered information in csv file with similar to original file name.
Better work with links to certain sites, not aggregators or redirecting links.
